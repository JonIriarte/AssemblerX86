# Assemblerx86

As it's name implies this is X86 assembler related stuff. 
 
  Following the Tradition I've decided to begin with the "Hello World!" program. I've created my code following the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgEGAaYdABA 
 but I haven't been able to run my code because I'm working in a Windwos 10 envorinment with VSC and I haven't find out how to configure the NASM needed to run my code.
